# Tower of Light

Tower of Light is an indie, 2D turn-based strategy RPG where you lead the prince of the kingdom of Valentia and his army to take back the Tower of Light from the Chaos army that is trying to take over the world. The game emphasizes tactical decision-making, with each move being critical to the success of your army. The game is made from scratch in Java and it features 2D animations, as well as music and sound effects, and was made for my MSc course Object Oriented Programming.
